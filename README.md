## 🚀 Distributed Job Queue System (Real-Time + Scalable + AI-Powered)

> A **production-grade distributed job queue system** with **real-time monitoring dashboard**, **AI-powered failure diagnosis**, and **priority-based scheduling**, built using **Node.js, BullMQ, Redis, WebSockets, and Google Gemini API** — inspired by architectures used at Uber, Zomato, and Amazon.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Modern applications require handling tasks asynchronously (emails, notifications, background processing).
This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable and fault-tolerant job processing system** with:

* ⚡ High-performance queue system
* 🔄 Background workers
* 📊 Real-time dashboard
* 📡 Event-driven architecture
* 🤖 AI-powered failure diagnosis
* 🧠 Priority-based job scheduling

---

## 🖥️ Admin Dashboard (Bull Board)
Real-time monitoring of job queue including:
- Active jobs
- Completed jobs
- Failed jobs
- Delayed jobs
- Prioritized jobs
- Logs & Error tracking

## 📊 User Dashboard
Frontend interface built with React for:
- Adding new jobs (with priority selection)
- Viewing job status
- Analytics & charts
- Retry failed jobs
- AI-powered failure diagnosis
- Queue controls

### 🔹 Reliability & Security

* 🔄 Retry mechanism with backoff strategy
* ☠️ Dead Letter Queue (DLQ)
* 🛡️ Rate limiting (API protection)
* 🔐 Helmet security middleware
* ✅ Input validation (Joi)

---

### 🔹 🤖 AI-Powered Failure Diagnosis

* 🧠 Integrated **Google Gemini API** to automatically diagnose failed jobs
* 📋 Analyzes job's `failedReason`, `stacktrace`, and `data` to generate:
  - **Root Cause** — plain-English explanation of why the job failed
  - **Error Type** — classification (e.g., network timeout, invalid input, external service failure, code bug)
  - **Suggested Fix** — a concrete next debugging step
  - **Retry Recommendation** — whether the job should be auto-retried or needs manual intervention
* ⚡ Diagnosis results cached in Redis (per job ID) to avoid redundant Gemini API calls
* 🎯 Diagnosis is grounded strictly in actual error data — no speculative/hallucinated causes
* 🖱️ Accessible via a **"Diagnose"** button on failed jobs directly in the dashboard

---

### 🔹 🧠 Priority-Based Job Scheduling

* 🎚️ Jobs can be assigned a priority level at creation: **Critical, High, Normal, Low**
* ⏫ Higher-priority jobs (e.g., password reset emails) are processed before lower-priority ones (e.g., analytics jobs), even if added later
* 🏷️ Priority displayed as a color-coded badge in the Jobs table
* 📌 Populates the previously empty **PRIORITIZED** tab in Bull Board with real, live data
* ✅ Defaults to "Normal" priority if not specified, keeping existing job flows backward-compatible
