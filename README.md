## 🚀 Distributed Job Queue System (Real-Time + Scalable + AI-Powered)

> A **production-grade distributed job queue system** with **real-time monitoring dashboard**, **AI-powered failure diagnosis**, **hybrid local + cloud failure triage**, and **priority-based scheduling**, built using **Node.js, BullMQ, Redis, WebSockets, Google Gemini API, and a fine-tuned local LLM** — inspired by architectures used at Uber, Zomato, and Amazon.

---

## 📌 Introduction

Modern applications require handling tasks asynchronously (emails, notifications, background processing).
This project demonstrates how to build a **scalable and fault-tolerant job processing system** with:

* ⚡ High-performance queue system
* 🔄 Background workers
* 📊 Real-time dashboard
* 📡 Event-driven architecture
* 🤖 AI-powered failure diagnosis (hybrid: local fine-tuned model + Gemini API fallback)
* 🧠 Priority-based job scheduling

## 🖥️ Admin Dashboard (Bull Board)
Real-time monitoring of job queue including:
- Active jobs
- Completed jobs
- Failed jobs
- Delayed jobs
- Prioritized jobs
- Logs & Error tracking

### 🔹 🤖 AI-Powered Failure Diagnosis

. Integrated **Google Gemini API** to automatically diagnose failed jobs
. 📋 Analyzes job's `failedReason`, `stacktrace`, and `data` to generate:
  - **Root Cause** — plain-English explanation of why the job failed
  - **Error Type** — classification (e.g., network timeout, invalid input, external service failure, code bug)
  - **Suggested Fix** — a concrete next debugging step
  - **Retry Recommendation** — whether the job should be auto-retried or needs manual intervention
. Diagnosis results cached in Redis (per job ID) to avoid redundant Gemini API calls
. Diagnosis is grounded strictly in actual error data — no speculative/hallucinated causes
. Accessible via a **"Diagnose"** button on failed jobs directly in the dashboard

---

### 🔹 🧬 Hybrid AI Triage — Fine-Tuned Local Model + Gemini Fallback (New)

* 🚀 Added a **fine-tuned local LLM** (LoRA fine-tuned Phi-3-mini / Llama-3.2-3B via Hugging Face `transformers` + `peft`) as a fast, low-cost **first-pass classifier** for failed jobs
* 🧭 **Hybrid triage router**: every failure is first sent to the local fine-tuned model; if its confidence score is above threshold, its classification is used directly and the Gemini API call is skipped entirely
* 🔁 If confidence is low, or the local model service is unavailable, the request **falls through unchanged** to the existing Gemini diagnosis flow — original behavior is fully preserved
* 🐳 Local model served via a **separate, isolated FastAPI microservice**, run as an additional Docker container — does not modify any existing Node.js service, route, or Gemini integration
* 🚩 Fully controlled by a feature flag (`ENABLE_LOCAL_TRIAGE`) — can be switched off instantly to revert to 100% original Gemini-only behavior with zero code changes
* 📊 Tracks and logs: local-model-handled vs. Gemini-fallback rate, latency per path, and classification agreement between the two, for direct before/after comparison
* 💰 Result: near-zero marginal cost and lower latency for common/known failure types, while retaining Gemini's deeper reasoning for unfamiliar or ambiguous failures

---

### 🔹 🧠 Priority-Based Job Scheduling

* 🎚️ Jobs can be assigned a priority level at creation: **Critical, High, Normal, Low**
* ⏫ Higher-priority jobs (e.g., password reset emails) are processed before lower-priority ones (e.g., analytics jobs), even if added later
* 🏷️ Priority displayed as a color-coded badge in the Jobs table
* 📌 Populates the previously empty **PRIORITIZED** tab in Bull Board with real, live data
* ✅ Defaults to "Normal" priority if not specified, keeping existing job flows backward-compatible

## ⚙️ Installation & Setup

### 1️⃣ Clone Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/distributed-job-queue.git
cd distributed-job-queue
```

---

### 2️⃣ Backend Setup

```bash
cd server
npm install
```

Create `.env` file:

```env
PORT=5000
REDIS_URL=your_redis_connection_string
GEMINI_API_KEY=your_gemini_api_key

# New — Hybrid AI Triage config
ENABLE_LOCAL_TRIAGE=true
LOCAL_MODEL_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:8001
LOCAL_TRIAGE_CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD=0.75
```

Run server + worker:

```bash
npm run dev
```

---

### 3️⃣ Frontend Setup

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

---

### 4️⃣ Local Model Service Setup (New)

```bash
cd python-model-service
pip install -r requirements.txt
uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8001
```

Or run everything together via Docker Compose (existing services unchanged, new service added):

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

> 💡 Set `ENABLE_LOCAL_TRIAGE=false` in `.env` at any time to disable the local model path entirely and fall back to 100% original Gemini-only diagnosis behavior.

---

## 🚀 Usage Guide

### 🔹 Add Job

* Click **"Add Job"** button
* Select a **priority level** (Critical / High / Normal / Low)
* Job is pushed into Redis queue and processed according to priority

### 🔹 Monitor Jobs

* View live updates in dashboard
* No manual refresh required

### 🔹 Retry Failed Jobs

* Click **Retry** button
* Job reprocessed instantly

### 🔹 Diagnose Failed Jobs

* Click **Diagnose** on any failed job
* Request is routed through the hybrid triage layer: local fine-tuned model attempts classification first, falling back to Gemini automatically if needed
* View AI-generated root cause, error type, suggested fix, retry recommendation, and which path (local model vs. Gemini) produced the result
